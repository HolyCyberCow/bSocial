## How to run

First install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Then use one of the scripts (defined in the package.json) to build:

```bash
npm run build
```

run:

```bash
npm run start
```

format:

```bash
npm run format
```

lint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

or just run for development by watching for changes with nodemon.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Development

This project uses a simple version of `GitFlow`. The first, initial commit
inside the `master` branch will contain the minimal project setup, further
features / additions will be implemented via `feature` branches and merged into
the `develop` branch.

For now, no `release` branches will be made, due to the app still being in the
early stages of the development.
